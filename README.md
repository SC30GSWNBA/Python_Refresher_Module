# Python_Refresher_Module
Creating a Repository as a refresher for anyone willing to learn basics of Python

Hello All,

Feel free to have a look around. All the notebooks uploaded could be executed in Colab/Jupyter. I created this respository for myself as a revision exercise.
Hope it helps others who have some/limited/zero knowledge of programming in Python. Comments/Suggestions are most welcome.

Thanks,
